# Keystroke-Dynamics-Mominul

In our project, we are interested in incorporating Keystroke Dynamics into our Password Based Security System.One concern about this type of system is whether or not a user is consistent over time in how they type a given passcode. For this project we were given access to a group of 51 individuals who have typed a passcode for a specific system.
The passcode used by this code is :  .tie5Roanl
Dr. Roy Maxian and colleagues recruited 51 subjects at CMU. Subjects completed 8 data collection sessions, with each session composed of 50 times of typing the above passcode. Each session was one day apart. We are asked to explore the conjecture that a personâ€™s typing dynamics changes over time using methods taught in STAT 601 Course.
